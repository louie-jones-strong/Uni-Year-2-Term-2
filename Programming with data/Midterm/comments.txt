1. Intro is good. References (e.g. [1]) are probably unnecessary but would nice.
    e.g. dissertations found

2.2.1 Doesn't make it easier for anyone to do what?
And your analysis won't add sufficient information or cross-correlation to be an ethical concern.

2.3 You could add links:
<twitter API>
https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape

2.? Code cell "# Import libraries and modules" 
    Does Jupiter Notebook allow you to give a heading for this? Or are inline comments sufficient?

3.0 A big limitation is that you are showing correlations rather than causal links.

3.2 Do the following count as limitations?
    MinDaysBetweenJumps = 7
    StockJumpTriggerRatio = 0.5
    StockJumpTriggerPercentage = 1
    TwitterJumpTriggerRatio = 1.25
    TwitterJumpTriggerPercentage = 7.5

3.2 code cell 2  "#what users do we care about"
    is "users" the correct terminology? companies? stocks?

outputs just before 4.0
    A title and / or description would be helpful
    Does you username in the console output breach any submission rules?

4.2 add a link?
https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment

Add a markdown to identify which word cloud is which.

The markdowns below graphs to describe them is helpful. More of these would be nice.

As previously mentioned, output as pdf as well would be nice
